# AnagramSolver

Was part of an assignment for an old course project to set up something to recognize how many anagrams were present in a few provided dictionaries, some of which containing actual words while others contained gibberish.  Wasn't the most optimized, as I recall, but it managed to do what they were looking for in a reasonable amount of time.
